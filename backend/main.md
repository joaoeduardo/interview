First, the team needs to define the project's scope. After, we need to draw the project canvas. Then, the orgranogram, dividing the project into several parts, defining the hours, the cost and the responsable of each part. Then, is made the WBS. Then, is made an analise of risk, so we can calculate the contingency costs. Finally, each one implements its respective part, following git flow branching model.
